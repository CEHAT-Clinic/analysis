# analysis

This repository contains the R package that we use in our app repository (https://github.com/CEHAT-Clinic/app). It contains all of the functions that we use to build dataframes, create graphs, and run our interpolation. Above each function there is a description of the function's parameters and return values, as well as what the function does.
