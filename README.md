# analysis

This repository contains the R package that we use in our app repository (https://github.com/CEHAT-Clinic/app). It contains all of the functions that we use to build dataframes, create graphs, and run our interpolation. Above each function there is a description of the function's parameters and return values, as well as what the function does.

To install this package, paste **devtools::install_github("CEHAT-Clinic/analysis")** into the command line in the "Console" pane of an RStudio session, and hit "Enter." If you are prompted to update 40 or so packages, press "Enter" again to skip this and continue (this will not affect the functionality of any function in the package).
